<h3>Bio</h3>

<p>I’m a 9th grader attending Sunset Junior High. In school, I enjoy studying English and Human Geography. Although the work required for our classes are difficult at times, I still find a way to get it done somehow.
  The teachers here are super helpful, and my friends at school make the experience more enjoyable.
  I learn best through practice and repetition, but I occassionally need a break every now and then.</p>

<p>Outside of school, I enjoy competitive dance and taekwondo. Basically, I'm at the studio the whole week, whether it's at dance or taekwondo. I teach younger children for my first hour at the studio and practice with my team for the next hour.
  My favorite style of dance is contemporary, and my favorite taekwondo style to compete in is sports poomsae. My family consists of my mom, dad, and myself. We have a dog named Boogie, who is very playful.
